# TP Gestión de Datos

Group assignment for the subject "Data Management" (Gestión de datos).

In this project we were asked to migrate a given database that wasn't normalized (all the data was in a single table) to a normalized one. The model was based on a clothes shop.

The second part consisted in making a Business Intelligence model from our already normalized database, and making some analysis that were required. For example, the top 5 products with the most annual profit, or the average of delivery cost in each month and year. We used the STAR schema for this.

T-SQL with the SQL Server engine (2012 version) was used for the project.
